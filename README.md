## Section 1 - Primer Challenges
### Primer 1 - Fahrenheit / Centigrade Conversion
This challenge requires us to allow a user to enter a value before selecting whether to convert it from Fahrenheit to Centigrade or Centigrade to Fahrenheit.  As part of the initial design the conversion algorithms were needed for both calculations. 

To help complete this challenge I needed to break the overall problem down into the following main tasks: 
* Get data from the user
* Verify the data is in a suitable format
* Create a method to convert F->C
* Create a method to convert C->F
 
#### Reflection (as well as issues, challenges & resolutions)
We have been doing quite a lot of SOLID principle work recently at work and so this was timely. Ideally, I would have liked to have renamed the main function, currently "fahrenheitCentigradeConversion", as this is not actually doing the conversion anymore, however this would break the calls in main.cpp and I thought best not to.

I would also like to pull out parts of the if statements, line 32, into separate functions but it started to feel like I was overthinking things. 

Didn't really have any issues to speak of, other than getting the output function to return a string rather than output it to screen. It seems there isn't an easy way to convert floats to strings in C++ so left if as a void function. Not ideal.

## Section 2 - Programming Paradigms
### Programming Paradigms
Simply put, a programming paradigm, for example, procedural, object-oriented, functional, structured, declarative, imperative and event driven can be described as a specific approach used when trying to solve a problem.  Although many programming languages can (and do) support multiple paradigms this discussion will focus more specifically on the possible benefits with examples of the potential differences and similarities of five from the above list. These are ...
